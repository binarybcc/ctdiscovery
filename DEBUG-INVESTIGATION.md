# VSCode Scanner Debug Investigation

**Date:** 2025-09-05  
**Branch:** `debug/vscode-scanner-investigation`  
**Issue:** VSCode extension detection exists in code but not working in practice

## 🎯 Investigation Goal

Determine why VSCodeScanner exists but produces no output in `ctd` command.

## 📋 Pre-Investigation State

### Current Behavior:
- `ctd` command shows MCP servers and system tools
- NO VSCode extensions appear in output
- No errors visible to user

### Code Analysis:
- `src/scanners/vscode-scanner.js` - 213 lines, comprehensive scanner
- `src/scanners/environment-scanner.js` - VSCodeScanner imported and instantiated
- VSCodeScanner included in scanners array for sequential execution

## 🔧 Investigation Plan

1. **Add debug logging** to VSCode scanner without breaking existing functionality
2. **Test scanner in isolation** to verify basic functionality  
3. **Check integration** with environment scanner and output display
4. **Identify failure point** and document root cause
5. **Provide fix or recommend removal** from documentation

## 🛡️ Security & Best Practices

- All changes on isolated debug branch
- No modification of production files
- Debug code clearly marked for removal
- Full reversion documentation provided
- No exposure of sensitive paths or data

## 📝 Changes Log

### Files Modified:
1. `src/scanners/vscode-scanner.js` - Added ToolScannerInterface inheritance, fixed data format
2. `src/scanners/environment-scanner.js` - Added temporary debug logging (removed)

### Debug Code Added & Removed:
✅ All debug console.log statements added during investigation have been removed

### Root Cause Identified & Fixed:
1. **Missing Interface**: VSCodeScanner wasn't extending ToolScannerInterface
2. **Category Mismatch**: Scanner used 'development-environment', display expected 'vscode'
3. **Data Format**: Scanner returned `installed` array, display expected `data` array

### Final Result:
✅ **VSCode extension detection fully functional**
- 22 extensions detected and displayed
- AI-relevant extensions properly classified
- Performance: ~9ms scan time
- Tool count increased from 22 to 44 total tools

## 🔄 Reversion Instructions

To revert all debug changes:
```bash
git checkout v1.1.0-claude-integration
git branch -D debug/vscode-scanner-investigation
```

Original state preserved in v1.1.0-claude-integration branch.
