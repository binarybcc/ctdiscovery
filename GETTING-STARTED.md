# Run the tool (that's it!)
ctd

# Alternative: show just conversation starter
ctdtools

# Help and options
ctd --help
```

## What This Solves

**Before CTD:**
- "Tool not available" errors with no context
- Guessing what Claude can access
- Inconsistent AI coding sessions
- Environment uncertainty

**After CTD:**
- Know exactly what's available
- Quick environment overview
- Consistent AI workflow setup
- Clear tool visibility

## Next Steps

1. **Run the scan** - See what you discover!
2. **Check the conversation starter** - `ctd tools` gives you ready-to-paste context for Claude
3. **Share with your team** - Standardize everyone's environment knowledge
4. **Report issues** - Help improve CTD for everyone

## Common Use Cases

### For Individual Developers
```bash
# Before starting an AI coding session
ctd

# Copy the generated conversation starter
cat .ctdiscovery-conversation-starter.txt
# [Paste into Claude conversation]
```

### For Environment Documentation
```bash
# Document your current setup
ctd > my-environment.txt
# Keep for reference or troubleshooting
```

### For Debugging "Tool Not Available"
```bash
# When Claude says a tool isn't available
ctd | grep [tool-name]
# Verify if tool is actually accessible
```

## Troubleshooting

### Installation Issues
```bash
# If global install fails, try local:
git clone https://github.com/binarybcc/ctdiscovery.git
cd ctdiscovery
npm install
npm run scan
```

### Permission Errors
```bash
# On macOS, if permission denied:
sudo npm install -g https://github.com/binarybcc/ctdiscovery.git
```

### No Tools Found
- Verify you're in a development environment
- Check that Node.js 16+ is installed
- Try running with `--verbose` flag for debug info
