# CTDiscovery - The Missing Tool Every AI Developer Needs

**The Problem:** You're working with Claude Code, but you never really know what tools Claude actually has access to. Is git working? Which MCP servers are connected? What programming languages are available? You're flying blind.

**The Solution:** CTDiscovery (`ctd`) - a 3-second scan that shows you exactly what's available in your development environment and automatically keeps Claude informed.

## What it does:
- 🔍 **Scans your environment** - System tools, MCP servers, languages, build tools
- 📊 **Health checks everything** - Shows what's working vs. broken
- 🤖 **Updates Claude's awareness** - Auto-integrates with CLAUDE.md files  
- 💬 **Generates conversation starters** - Copy-paste context for new Claude sessions
- 📁 **Creates visible reports** - Human-readable tool inventories for teams

## Why you need it:
- Stop guessing what tools Claude can use
- Onboard team members with environment snapshots  
- Troubleshoot "Claude says tool not available" issues
- Keep documentation in sync with reality

## Quick Start:
**One command:** `ctd --integrate-claude` and your CLAUDE.md stays current automatically.

## Perfect for:
- AI-assisted development teams
- Solo developers with complex toolchains  
- Anyone using Claude Code professionally

## The Elevator Pitch:
> *"It's like `docker ps` but for your entire AI development environment - finally know what Claude can actually do."*

**Ready to stop guessing what tools you have? Try CTDiscovery.**
