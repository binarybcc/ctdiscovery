# Project Startup Checklist
**Expert Team Standards for Scalable Development**

## Pre-Development Questions (Answer These First!)

### Project Scope & Growth
- [ ] **What's the MVP?** (Minimum viable version)
- [ ] **What's the 2-year vision?** (How big could this get?)
- [ ] **Expected user volume?** (10 users vs 10,000 users = different architecture)
- [ ] **Team size trajectory?** (Solo → small team → larger team)
- [ ] **Technical debt tolerance?** (Move fast vs. build right)

### Technology Context
- [ ] **Existing tech stack constraints?** (Must integrate with X system)
- [ ] **Performance requirements?** (Sub-second loads, mobile data usage)
- [ ] **Browser/device support?** (IE11 vs modern browsers only)
- [ ] **Accessibility requirements?** (WCAG compliance level needed)
- [ ] **Internationalization needed?** (Multi-language, RTL support)

### Team & Maintenance
- [ ] **Who maintains this long-term?** (You, team, client, vendor)
- [ ] **Skill level of maintainers?** (Beginner vs expert developers)
- [ ] **Documentation requirements?** (Self-documenting vs heavy docs)
- [ ] **Testing strategy?** (Manual testing vs automated test suite)

## Architecture Decisions (Make These Early)

### Code Organization Strategy
Choose your philosophy BEFORE writing code:

**OPTION A: Monolithic (Small-Medium projects)**
```
/src/
  styles.css
  main.js
  index.html
```

**OPTION B: Feature-Based (Growing projects)**
```
/src/
  /components/
    /navigation/
    /dashboard/
  /shared/
    /styles/
    /utils/
```

**OPTION C: Domain-Driven (Large projects)**
```
/src/
  /user-management/
  /billing/
  /reporting/
  /shared/
```

### CSS Architecture Decision
Choose ONE approach - DON'T MIX:

```css
/* Option A: Utility-First (Tailwind-like) */
<div class="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4 p-6 bg-white rounded-lg">

/* Option B: Component-First (BEM-like) */
<div class="dashboard-card dashboard-card--large">

/* Option C: CSS-in-JS (Styled Components) */
const Card = styled.div`
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
`;
```

### State Management Strategy
```javascript
// SIMPLE PROJECTS: Vanilla JS + localStorage
const state = {
  user: JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('user')) || null
};

// MEDIUM PROJECTS: Custom state manager
class AppState {
  constructor() { this.subscribers = []; }
  setState(newState) { /* notify subscribers */ }
}

// COMPLEX PROJECTS: Redux/Zustand/Context
// (But NOT for simple projects - over-engineering!)
```

## Scalability Patterns (Implement From Day 1)

### Configuration Management
```javascript
// BAD: Hard-coded values scattered everywhere
const API_URL = 'https://api.mysite.com';
const MAX_ITEMS = 50;

// GOOD: Centralized config
const CONFIG = {
  API: {
    BASE_URL: process.env.API_URL || 'https://api.mysite.com',
    TIMEOUT: 5000,
    RETRY_ATTEMPTS: 3
  },
  UI: {
    MAX_ITEMS_PER_PAGE: 50,
    ANIMATION_DURATION: 300
  }
};
```

### Error Handling Strategy
```javascript
// BAD: Inconsistent error handling
try { await fetch('/api/data'); } catch (e) { console.log('oops'); }

// GOOD: Centralized error handling
class ErrorHandler {
  static handle(error, context) {
    // Log to service
    // Show user-friendly message
    // Track for debugging
  }
}
```

### Performance Patterns
```javascript
// Implement these patterns early:

// Debouncing for user input
const debounce = (fn, delay) => {
  let timeoutId;
  return (...args) => {
    clearTimeout(timeoutId);
    timeoutId = setTimeout(() => fn(...args), delay);
  };
};

// Lazy loading for large datasets
const lazyLoad = (callback) => {
  const observer = new IntersectionObserver(callback);
  return observer;
};

// Caching for expensive operations
const cache = new Map();
const memoize = (fn) => (...args) => {
  const key = JSON.stringify(args);
  if (cache.has(key)) return cache.get(key);
  const result = fn(...args);
  cache.set(key, result);
  return result;
};
```

## Technical Debt Prevention

### Refactoring Triggers
Set these rules and stick to them:
- [ ] **File > 300 lines** → Split into smaller modules  
- [ ] **Function > 50 lines** → Break into smaller functions
- [ ] **Duplicated code 3+ times** → Extract to shared utility
- [ ] **Magic numbers used** → Move to configuration
- [ ] **No tests for critical paths** → Add tests before continuing

### Regular Architecture Reviews
Schedule monthly "architecture debt" reviews:
- What patterns are emerging that weren't planned?
- What assumptions have changed?
- What components need refactoring?
- What new tools/patterns should we adopt?

## The Golden Rules

1. **Start simple, architect for growth** - Don't over-engineer, but plan for scale
2. **Consistency beats perfection** - Pick patterns and stick to them
3. **Document decisions, not just code** - Future you will thank present you
4. **Automate the boring stuff** - Linting, formatting, testing, deployment
5. **Plan for team growth** - Code should be readable by others
6. **Measure what matters** - Performance, user experience, maintainability

**Usage:** Review this checklist before starting any project larger than a simple landing page.
