Title: "CTDiscovery v1.2.0: First tool to detect VSCodium extensions alongside VSCode"

Finally built something I've been wanting - a development environment scanner that actually understands the full VSCode ecosystem.

**What makes it unique:**
- Detects extensions from VSCode stable, Insiders, AND VSCodium
- Cross-platform (proper Windows paths, not just Unix)
- AI-relevant extension classification
- 40+ development tools detected total

**Why I built this:**
Tired of tools that only recognize standard VSCode installations. If you're running Insiders for beta features or VSCodium for open source principles, your environment scanner should see that too.

**Technical details:**
- Platform-specific path detection using OS conventions
- Graceful handling of missing variants (no errors if only one installed)
- Rich metadata extraction (publisher, version, contributions)
- ~8ms scan time for VSCode extensions

GitHub: https://github.com/binarybcc/ctdiscovery
NPM: `npm install -g ctdiscovery`

Anyone else frustrated by incomplete environment detection? What variants are you running?
