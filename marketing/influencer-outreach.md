# Phase 1: Influencer Outreach Strategy

## Primary Target: Nate Jones (@nate.b.jones)

### Background Research Summary
- **TikTok**: 4.3M Likes, 365.1K Followers
- **Content Focus**: Practical AI implementation, developer tools, career advice
- **Audience**: Professional developers, AI practitioners, product managers
- **Style**: Direct, practical, "no fluff" approach
- **Recent Coverage**: Devin AI, prompt engineering tools, AI productivity stack

### Outreach Message

**Platform**: Email (via website contact) or TikTok DM
**Subject**: "AI developer tool that solves environment uncertainty - perfect for your audience?"

```
Hey Nate,

Love your daily AI breakdowns on TikTok/Substack - you nail the practical implementation angle that developers actually need.

Built something your audience might find useful: ClaudeToolDiscovery (CTD). It's a CLI that shows developers exactly what tools their AI coding assistant can access.

**The problem:** Every Claude Code user has hit "tool not available" errors and wondered "wait, can Claude actually access X?" It kills productivity and makes onboarding new team members painful.

**The solution:** 3-second environment scan that shows everything Claude can see:

```bash
npm install -g https://github.com/binarybcc/ctdiscovery.git
ctd scan
```

Early feedback: Developers finding 20-50 tools they didn't know Claude could access.

**Why it fits your content:**
- Practical developer productivity tool (like your Devin/Cursor coverage)  
- Solves an annoying daily problem (your wheelhouse)
- Clean CLI that "just works" (no configuration needed)
- Perfect for your "AI tools that deliver ROI" theme

Happy to share early access or demo if it seems interesting for your audience. No pressure either way - just thought it aligned well with your practical AI implementation focus.

Best,
[Your name]

P.S. Your recent piece on prompt engineering tools was spot-on. The "AI is only as good as your prompts" angle is exactly right.
```

### Follow-up Strategy
- **Wait 1 week** before follow-up if no response
- **Share metrics** if adoption grows (GitHub stars, user feedback)
- **Offer exclusive demo** for his Substack subscribers
- **No more than 2 follow-ups** to avoid being pushy

## Timing and Coordination

### Week 1
- **Day 1**: Nate Jones outreach
- **Day 3**: Simon Willison (if active on GitHub/Mastodon)
- **Day 5**: Swyx (if no response from Nate)

### Week 2
- **Day 8**: Follow up with Nate if interested
- **Day 10**: Matt Berman and Elvis Saravia
- **Day 12**: Harrison Chase

### Success Metrics
- **Response rate**: Target 20% (1-2 responses from 5 outreaches)
- **Coverage**: Even 1 mention by major influencer = success
- **Traffic**: Track GitHub clicks from social platforms
- **Community growth**: New Discord/GitHub followers

## Risk Management
- **Don't mass spam** - personalize each message
- **Quality over quantity** - better to do 5 great outreaches than 15 mediocre
- **Respect no/silence** - one follow-up maximum
- **Add value first** - engage with their content before pitching
