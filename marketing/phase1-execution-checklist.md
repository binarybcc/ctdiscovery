```

TIL: Claude Code can see 47 tools in my environment. Here's how to check yours:

```

## ⚡ Emergency Responses

### If Tool Doesn't Work for Someone
```
Thanks for trying it! Can you share:
1. Your OS and Node version
2. The exact error message
3. Output of `which ctd` after install

Happy to debug - this helps improve the tool for everyone!
```

### If Asked About Roadmap
```
Great question! v1.2 priorities based on community feedback:
- Windows/Linux testing and fixes  
- More detailed analysis (tool dependencies, conflicts)
- Integration guides for popular MCP servers
- Team sharing features

What would be most valuable for your workflow?
```

### If Compared to Other Tools
```
Good point! CTD focuses specifically on AI development environments - showing what Claude/AI assistants can access rather than general system info.

The 3-second scan and Claude conversation starter features are designed for the "AI coding session setup" workflow specifically.

Have you found other tools that solve this particular use case?

## 🚨 Red Flags to Avoid

### Don't:
- Spam multiple subreddits simultaneously
- Over-promise features that don't exist
- Argue in comments (stay helpful and humble)
- Post identical content (customize for each platform)
- Follow up more than once with influencers

### Do:
- Engage authentically in discussions
- Thank people for feedback (positive or negative)
- Document issues and feature requests
- Share metrics transparently
- Help debug problems users encounter

## 📞 Escalation Plan

### If Viral Success (>500 GitHub stars in 24h):
1. Prepare server capacity for increased traffic
2. Monitor issues closely for bugs
3. Draft follow-up content for momentum
4. Reach out to additional influencers while trending

### If Slow Adoption (<10 stars after Week 1):
1. Analyze which platforms got engagement
2. Interview early users for feedback
3. Consider pivoting messaging
4. Focus on most promising channel for Week 2

### If Negative Feedback:
1. Respond professionally and helpfully
2. Fix legitimate issues quickly
3. Thank critics for feedback
4. Document lessons learned for future launches
