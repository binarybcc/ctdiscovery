# Phase 1: Discord Community Messages

## Anthropic Discord - #claude-code Channel

### Initial Share Message

```
Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹ 

Just built something for a problem I kept running into - those annoying "tool not available" errors when using Claude Code.

Built ClaudeToolDiscovery (CTD) - scans your environment and shows exactly what Claude can access:

```bash
npm install -g https://github.com/binarybcc/ctdiscovery.git
ctd scan
```

Found 47 tools in my setup I didn't know Claude could see! Dashboard shows everything in ~3 seconds.

Would love feedback from other Claude Code users. Anyone else dealt with environment uncertainty?

### Follow-up Engagement Messages

**When someone mentions tool issues:**
```
@username CTD might help with that! I built it after hitting the same "tool not available" problems. Quick scan shows exactly what's accessible: https://github.com/binarybcc/ctdiscovery
```

**When sharing interesting discoveries:**
```
Update on CTD usage: Found some interesting patterns in different environments. Seems like most people have 20-50 tools they don't know about. The MCP server discovery has been super helpful for debugging!
```

**When asking for feedback:**
```
For anyone who's tried CTD - what tools did you discover that surprised you? Thinking about adding more detailed analysis in v1.2 based on what people find most useful.
```

## Discord Server Strategy

### Other Discord Servers to Target:

1. **AI Engineers Discord**
   - #tools channel
   - More technical audience
   - Focus on MCP server discovery

2. **Developer Communities**
   - #cli-tools channels
   - Emphasize developer productivity angle

### Messaging Tone Guidelines

- **Casual and helpful** - not salesy
- **Problem-first** - start with the pain point
- **Community-focused** - ask for feedback
- **Technical but accessible** - show the CLI but explain the value

### Engagement Best Practices

1. **Respond quickly** to comments and questions
2. **Share metrics** if adoption picks up ("20 people tried it, found avg 35 tools")
3. **Document feedback** for product improvements
4. **Help debug** specific environment issues
5. **Thank contributors** who provide feedback or report bugs

### Timing Strategy

- **Weekday mornings (9-11am EST)** - developers checking Discord before work
- **Weekday evenings (6-8pm EST)** - active community time
- **Avoid Mondays** - people catching up
- **Tuesday-Thursday optimal** - highest engagement

### Success Metrics to Track

- Direct downloads from Discord links
- GitHub stars from Discord traffic
- Community feedback quality
- Follow-up conversations generated
- Issues/feature requests from Discord users
