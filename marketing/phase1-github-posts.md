## Claude Code GitHub Discussions - "Environment Discovery" Post

**Title:** üîç ClaudeToolDiscovery: Know what Claude can actually access in your environment

**Body:**
```markdown
Just released CTD after getting frustrated with constant "tool not available" errors.

**The Problem:** You're coding with Claude, try to use a tool, and get cryptic errors. Is it installed? Available? Configured correctly?

**The Solution:** One command shows everything:
```bash
npm install -g https://github.com/binarybcc/ctdiscovery.git
ctd scan
```

Found 47 tools in my environment I didn't know Claude could access:
- 23 MCP servers I forgot about  
- 12 system utilities
- 8 custom development tools
- 4 background services

**Features that actually work:**
- Dashboard with real-time tool status
- Claude conversation starters (`ctd tools`)
- <3 second scan times
- Cross-platform ready

GitHub: https://github.com/binarybcc/ctdiscovery

Would love feedback from the community on what tools you've discovered in your environments!

**For existing "tool not available" issues:**

Hey @username - just built something that might help with this exact problem: ClaudeToolDiscovery (CTD)

It scans your environment and shows exactly what Claude can access. Super quick to try:

```bash
npm install -g https://github.com/binarybcc/ctdiscovery.git
ctd scan
```

Shows all your MCP servers, system utilities, and development tools in a dashboard. Been using it to debug these exact "tool not available" issues.

Not trying to spam - genuinely think it solves the problem you're describing. Let me know if it helps!

## Reddit r/ClaudeAI Post

**Title:** PSA: You can see exactly what tools your AI assistant has access to

**Body:**
```markdown
Been using Claude Code professionally and kept hitting "tool not available" errors. Built a quick scanner to see what's actually available in my environment.

Turns out I had 47 tools Claude could access that I didn't know about:
- 23 MCP servers I'd installed and forgotten
- 12 system utilities
- 8 custom dev tools
- 4 background services

Made it into a simple CLI: https://github.com/binarybcc/ctdiscovery

```bash
npm install -g https://github.com/binarybcc/ctdiscovery.git
ctd scan
```

Dashboard shows everything in ~3 seconds. Has helped me understand why some sessions work great and others don't.

Anyone else had this "environment uncertainty" problem?
